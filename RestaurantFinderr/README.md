# Restaurant API

# How to start with docker

1. docker build . -t lendo
2. docker run -p 8080:8080 -e "KEY" lendo

## Introduction
The application uses Google Places API. This is needed to find the restaurants 
within a certain radius. With parameters as latitude, longitude, radius the application is going to give
a list with the restaurant found within the radius.  The application also uses a local cache, and it uses cache for atleast 
two reasons. 

1. When sending request to Google API it cost money. With the local cache the client doesÂ´nt have to send anymore request 
to google,it stores the data for 60s. This can be modified if wanted.
2. When sending a request the first time it takes roughly 432ms to get the response, with the local cache
it narrows it down to about 13ms. There we see a huge different in time. 
## Methods
To find restaurants the application needs a latitude and a longitude, a radius and a sortBy parameter.
If no radius is selected the default value of a radius is '100m'.

A client can also choose to get the result sorted by price, name and rating. If none is chosen 
the default value for sorting is 'price'. 

### Restaurants

rating,latitude and longitude value and if the restaurant is open or not.

### Input exceptions
Latitude has to be between -180 and 180. 
Longitude has to be between -90 and 90.

to Googles Places API is done.
